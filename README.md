## MVP
[x] get midi.js working -> use live server pls

[x] 16 instruments

[x] midi loop over fixed time seconds

[ ] keyboard interaction => assign focus to certain window for different instruments

[x] save loops / name loops / open loops

[ ] looper visualization

[ ] record

## Stretch

[ ] tempo - time/control (all things counting)

[ ] key/sample duration -> look into sound engineering the VEL/VOL/DEL for each instrument 

[ ] change instruments (not today)

[ ] CSS / material design for UX/UI?

[ ] Update Control Panel to do more things (metronome / record)

[ ] metronome

[ ] instrument volume slider

## Super Stretch

[ ] midi keyboard functionality.

## TODO TOMORROW

[ ] keyboard interaction => assign focus to certain window for different instruments.
Make sure you cannot play instrument and type on forms at same time

[ ] record on/off -> be able to still play if recording is off

[ ] js looper tick marks need to update on form update

[ ] js looper cursor needs to animate fluidly

[ ] js looper cursor should place a note on the staff

[ ] js looper needs to reset on form submission

[ ] pick metronome sound

[ ] metronome on/off
